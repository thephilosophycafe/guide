Logic Begins

The logic portion of the reading list requires serious reworking. None of the essays except Kripke's Semantical Considerations in Modal Logic are about logic, and that's a relatively technical paper requiring a background in modal logic to understand! The Tarski and Lewis papers are epistemology and metaphysics, respectively. The same criticism applies to the sole book recommended by this illustrious collection of gamers. There's no introductory books on modal logic, intuitionistic logic, multivalued and fuzzy logics, set theory, model theory, computability theory or proof theory relevant to anyone referencing a Word document they found on Discord to learn about logic. I'm hesitant to make recommendations, in part because most introductory books on logic are terrible.
Some recommendations:
* Priest, An Introduction to Non-classical Logic. Introduces propositional and first-order classical, intuitionistic, multivalued, and modal logics using tableaux with a lot of sensitivity to philosophical issues.
* van Dalen, Logic and Structure. Intermediate level introduction to first-order classical and intuitionistic logic.
* Blackburn et al., Modal Logic. Introduction to modal logic with emphasis on applications in computer science. Covers some advanced topics like topological semantics in an accessible way.
* Enderton, Elements of Set Theory, A Introduction to Mathematical Logic, Computability Theory. In descending order of goodness. Very accessible to undergraduates because they don't assume a great deal of mathematical sophistication.
* Cutland, Computability Theory. A very dated but accessible introduction to computability theory. I like it, but it's incomplete and despite covering very little ground a little terse.
* Sipser, An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata. Standard text in computer science for courses on theory of computation. (edited)
These recommendations are aimed at an undergraduates in philosophy or computer science.
* Urzyczyn and Sørensen, Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism. Introduction to lambda calculus and type theory. 
* Hindley and Seldin, Lambda Calculus and Combinators. A very accessible introduction to lambda calculus and combinatory calculi. It covers some of the same ground as the preceding book but with incredible detail, precision and clarity. 
I can't think of a single accessible introduction to model theory, but
* Button and Walsh, Philosophy and Model Theory
is very well written and introduces all the core concepts with extensive discussions of their applications to philosophy.
My list is pretty biased and contains some big gaps, but I'm trying to avoid both "big" and "hard" books.
Nope  I like the Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Readings (ed. Benacerraf & Putnam) anthology, though - it has lots of historically important papers that IIRC are missing from the Blackwell anthology.

Logic the basics

My suggestion for the reading list: https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=5157B9109CCD046E56C2C1F2F402BBFE


What do you think of this book as a suggestion for the list? It looks like it hits nearly all the major mathematical logic topics on the list in a single volume.

Logic End

Not sure if this is helpful, but University of Arizona hosts a few reading lists covering major works in the history of philosophy and areas in contemporary analytic philosophy: https://philosophy.arizona.edu/graduate-student-resources
They mostly cover primary sources, but a few introductory texts are listed. The lists vary in quality and scope.

In Search of the Black Fantastic by Richard Iton is really a work critiquing International Colonialism, and implicitly is an anarchistic work through how it formulates that critique. 
I'm trying think of where this might fit. Perhaps in the impromptu reading group for now, but may I humbly suggest that we start a new reading group channel for works about colonialism?
[6:15 PM]
To be more specific its a work that examines how International Colonialism has affected the development of Black liberation movements especially in America, and how that movement has at times has related to Black liberation movements internationally

Against Method by Paul Feyerabend for Philosophy of Science

For the feminist studies section, I'm suggesting: Joan W. Scott, “Experience,” in Feminists Theorize the Political, Eds. Judith Butler and Joan W. Scott, New York: Routledge, 1992, 22-40.
and: Judith Butler, “Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire,” in Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, New York: Routledge, 1990, 1-34.
the first paper by Joan Scott is significant in philosophy of history and in political theory, the second is Feminist Studies canon afaik.
also I really think MMP by Anscombe could be added to the ethics section, but I reckon based on what is currently in that section that it may be controversial: https://sites.pitt.edu/~mthompso/readings/mmp.pdf

imo malcolm x's autobio should be changed to malcolm x speaks


P. 7 Pol Phil: J. S. Mill On Liberty
P.11 Ancient Phil:  Presocratics?  The First Philosophers, Robin Waterfield.
P. 12 Medieval:  PSUEDO-Dionysius
P. 13 "Rose" should be Rise,  no "the" in front of Spirit (Hegel)
P.15 Existentialism:  add Heidegger Being & Time (even though it is already in Phenomenology)
P. 16 Some Recent Developments:  add Deleuze & Guattari
P.17 Primary Essays Collections:  add Richard Rorty editor, The Linguistic Turn...
[2:11 PM]
THIRD PARAGRAPH
“History books that talk about philosophy” are not “history of philosophy books”
Demarcate Blackburn from Hist of phil.
The magisterial 3,000 pp A Hist of Phil F. Copleston. [warn a person]
Kenney, A New Hist of Phil (4 vol) each vol has two parts, chronological & topical. 
Adamson Hist Phil w/o any Gaps (up to the Renaissance) 
or even the single volume Will Durant The Story of Philosophy.
"if for whatever reason X isn't for you" could be said after every recommendation so should be said after none.

and davis' book is titled incorrectly
I think that sandel's justice is good for someone completely new to ethical and political philosophy - I would put it before kymlicka

This is also good source for exploring animal rights thoery. However it is not just strictly philsosophy so.

I really like Bryan van Norden's Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy


so I have a couple of questions about the reading list
And maybe a couple of suggestions to help make it a lil better
Are we putting down introductory works to thinkers or the important works of thinkers for people to dive into?
And more along those lines, do we want general introductory secondaries that help to guide people into certain traditions and give much-needed context?
Because the section on Post-structuralism, Post-Modernism, and Deconstruction is bugging me.
I'm a bit surprised with how Derrida is being handled, for instance:
Why are we including the entirety of Writing and Difference when the most important aspect of that book is the John Hopkins' lecture, "Structures, Signs, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences"? Why not choose some of his interviews where he clarifies his own views on his own philosophy, his book on ethics and the Rights to Philosophy? Where is Paul De Man's "The Resistance To Theory" here? We could include Limited Inc. here for a demonstration of the usual confusion surrounding Derrida, but I'm cautious against it due to the advanced philosophy of language topic being discussed.
I've also got books to recommend on the reception of deconstruction in the U.S. to help contextualize how it's been disseminated in the years after John Hopkins, the importance of New Criticism for this reception, and generally how deconstruction has evolved over the years.

There are other questions I have about this section, that I think are lacking: where's Richard Rorty, at least Contingency, Irony, and Solidary? Why Discipline and Punish and the History of Sexuality, Vol. 1 with Foucault, but not some of his essays, like "What Is An Author?", "What Is Enlightenment?", his lectures at the College de France? We surely don't have to recommend books in this instance to get across what Foucault's primary concerns as a thinker were, nor to give people a sense of his methodology. The same could also be said of Lyotard and Baudrillard, the works of which being recommended are not something I'd throw at beginners.
Another thing too would be to introduce Gary Gutting's book on French Philosophy, Vincent Descombes' book, Alan D. Schrift's book, and Lee Braver's book on Anti-Realism and Realism in 20th Century Continental Philosophy.
Also things bugging me about the phenomenology section is how big and advanced the books being recommended are. Husserl's Ideas 1 is understandable, but there are better introductions and books to phenomenology that I've seen suggested here and there that at least give you some footing to address the questions Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Levinas are all concerned with.
And the lack of Shestov and Buber from Existentialism is, again, kind of disappointing, considering their importance in the development of existential themes.
