# The Philosophy Café

## Recommended Reading 

If you have never read one work of philosophy but want to, several places to start are listed here, though one is recommended over all the others. It is tempting to begin with famous works such as Plato’s Dialogues, Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, or with a contemporary logic textbook, but what is recommended here is to first learn how to read a work of philosophy. This is because if reading Kant’s Critique leads you to not read any further philosophy because you cannot understand it, then what was the point? For this reason it is highly recommended that you learn how to read a philosophical work first, which we give a small guide for at A Place to Start. 

After that, start off by branch. You should take a brief glance at the branches of philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, logic, etc.) to see what sounds interesting to you. Wikipedia is the least informative and the least accurate of the three sources listed here, but the most familiar source as well, so it should be used briefly to at least learn what the branches are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy#Branches_of_philosophy. The other two sources are Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) which is more informative and accurate than Wikipedia while still being accessible https://iep.utm.edu/, and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) which is the most informative of the three, though can quickly become a rabbit hole for those new to philosophy https://plato.stanford.edu/. IEP and SEP are great resources in general and should be returned to. Once you have decided on a branch that interests you, check back here. We have a list of short accessible essays to get you started for each branch, as well as the classics for that branch. Any first item in a list of essays, books, etc., is the first item you should read. This is true with the canon as well. Take Nietzsche as an example, On the Genealogy of Morality comes first in the list, Beyond Good and Evil comes second. On the Genealogy of Morality should be read first, and only after that should Beyond Good and Evil be read. 

If you are not interested in going into one particular branch, there are other options. If you wish to start at the beginning of the canon, we have a canon list and recommend you start with Plato’s Euthyphro. It is 15 pages long. If you would like a series of history books that talk about and survey the history of philosophy, we recommend A History of Philosophy by Frederick Charles Copleston. If you just want one book that goes over everything generally, read Simon Blackburn's Think. If for whatever reason Blackburn’s book isn’t for you, Bertrand Russell’s The Problems of Philosophy is an alternative. Finally, consider Oxford’s Very Short Introductions book series to any number of the branches, movements, thinkers, and texts below that interest you. More advanced readers will usually find Cambridge’s Companion series also quite useful.

## A Place to Start
	Your first essay is a guide on how to read philosophy. The essay by Concepción is made up of two parts, the first an argument that those new to philosophy should not deep dive into a classic, the second an appendix and guide called “How to Read Philosophy”. What should be apparent is that while this is a great resource, the essay was made for teachers for how they should teach their students. An even better alternative is linked here, where the principles of the Concepción essay were embraced but expressed with a student audience in mind rather a teacher. Choose either, with the latter being recommended 
• David W. Concepción, Reading Philosophy with Background Knowledge and Metacognition 
• https://falasafaz.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/how-to-read-philosophy/
	After reading the above, there is a collection of works listed below that get to the real gems of philosophy, the tools and methods, which a philosophy student slowly over years will come to realize if they instead choose to go through the canon. Going through the canon first is time consuming with no real benefit if you will eventually get to those works anyway. Something analogous would be to reverse-engineer what you would need to understand Einstein’s work on relativity by jumping into his papers without first learning the tools and methods of physics first. It is recommended to read these works going from the top down, and the first three are especially recommended before you continue on to a branch of philosophy or work through the canon. The Philosopher’s Toolkit is listed here more as a reference work, and is not necessary to read, though useful. After this, it is highly recommended to go through some introduction for formal logic. We have a recommendation for that as well in the Logic section of this reading list.

### Analytic
Analytic philosophy is made up of essays more so than the traditions and movements that came before it. Starting with an essay from a collection of essays on analytic philosophy such as Readings In Philosophical Analysis rather than starting with a book by a single philosopher is normal, and a small list is posted here. A shallow understanding of logic is recommended for this branch of philosophy, though Gottlob Frege’s essay Sense and Reference and Bertrand Russell’s essay On Denoting, both do not require this and are recommended as a starting point.
• Gottlob Frege, The Frege Reader
• G.E. Moore, Principia Ethica
• Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy, Philosophy of Logical Atomism
• Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
